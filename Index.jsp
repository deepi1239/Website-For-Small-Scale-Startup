            <h1 >What Do We Do</h1>
            <p>First, you need to gather all the necessary items: a coffee maker, a coffee mug, water, coffee grounds, and optionally, sugar and milk. Start by measuring a cup of water and pour it into the coffee maker. The amount of water you use will determine how much coffee you make, so adjust it according to your preference. Next, take one or two tablespoons of coffee grounds and put them in the coffee filter. The more coffee grounds you use, the stronger your coffee will be. Now, turn on the coffee maker and wait as the water heats up, passes through the coffee grounds, and drips into the pot. This process can take a few minutes, so be patient. When the coffee is ready, pour it into your mug. If you like your coffee sweet, add sugar to taste. If you prefer it creamy, add a little milk or cream. Be careful not to burn yourself when handling the hot coffee. Enjoy your homemade coffee at home, at school, or on the go. Remember, making coffee is not just about getting a caffeine boost. It’s also about taking a moment to relax and enjoy the simple pleasures of life. </p>

            <h3>History of Coffee</h3>
            <p>Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed under cultivation in the 15th century. One of many legends about the discovery of coffee is that of Kaldi, an Arab goatherd who was puzzled by the strange antics of his flock. About 850 CE Kaldi supposedly sampled the berries of the evergreen bush on which the goats were feeding and, on experiencing a sense of exhilaration, proclaimed his discovery to the world.By the end of the 17th century, coffeehouses were flourishing across Britain, the British colonies in America, and continental Europe.</p>

            <h3>Roasting</h3>
            <p>The aromatic and gustatory qualities of coffee are developed by the high temperatures to which they are subjected during roasting or broiling. Temperatures are raised progressively from about 180 to 250 °C (356 to 482 °F) and heated for anywhere from 7 to 20 minutes, depending on the type of light or dark roast desired. The most important effect of roasting is the appearance of the characteristic aroma of coffee, which arises from very complex chemical transformations within the bean. Roasting too long can destroy volatile flavour and aroma compounds, and Robusta beans are often deliberately overroasted (as in the dark French and Italian roasts) to rid the coffee of its natural harshness. See also coffee roasting.</p>

        <div class="article">
            <h3>Grinding</h3>
            <p>Some coffees are left as whole beans to be ground at the time of purchase or by the consumer at home. Much coffee, however, is ground, or milled, by the manufacturer immediately after roasting. In most modern roasting plants, grinding is accomplished by feeding the coffee through a series of serrated or scored rollers, set at progressively smaller gaps, that first crack the beans and then cut them to the desired particle size.

                The degree of fineness is important. If a coffee is too coarse, water filters through too fast to pick up flavour; if it is too fine, water filters through too slowly and retains particles that deposit at the bottom of the cup.</p>
